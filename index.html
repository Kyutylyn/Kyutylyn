            <h2>Interest</h2>
            <p> I have interest in writing ever since I was a kid, elementary to be exact. 
                At first I have this hobbies of reading textbooks, I always find joy and peace whenever I read.
                I love reading so much that I could sit the whole day just to read.
                I only love to read but I never had imagine myself writing a story.
                I remembered the first ever story that I've wrote,It was on third grade. 
                Funny how it started from jealousy and envy, and now it became my passion. 
                The funny reason why I started writing it's because, I was jealous of my classmates, they were too good when It comes to arts.
                They were able to draw disney princesses while I myself can't even draw a perfect circle.
                And that's where I come up to an idea of writing, at first no one could appreciate it,because my penmanship sucks.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>When I was on my 9th grade, maybe year 2015 or 2016, I decided to write stories on my notebook, and finished it on the same year.
            I also once tried joining a writing platform but it didn't work.
            I tried uploading my works on facebook,I even joined facebook groups for aspiring writers like me, where I could interact with my co-writers and readers.
            Aside from that I also challenge my self in writing poems, short stories,essays and reaction papers.
            I also lend help to some of my friends,when they have activities related to writing topics.
            I didn't get paid on writing but it doesn't matter, I enjoyed helping so that's enough.
